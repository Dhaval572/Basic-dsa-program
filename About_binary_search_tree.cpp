// Binary search tree 

/*
( Note: copy all text and paste in vs code to view properly )

A binary search tree (BST) is a type of binary tree that has the following properties:

	Properties:

		1). All nodes of left sub-tree are less than his root node.

		2). All nodes of right sub-tree are greter than than his root node.

		3). Left and Right sub-trees are also binary tree.
			it means sub-trees have maximum 2 child nodes.
		
		4). In this type of trees, there are not allowed duplicate nodes.

		5). In-order traversal of a binary search tree gives an ascending sorted array.

	So, here is one example of binary search tree:

	    10
       /  \
      5    15
     / \   / \
    3   7 12  17

	So, you can check that all properties are working or not.

	SO, let's travers this tree in In-order.

	In-order traversal: 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17

	So, you can see that These all values are sorted.( No. 5 properties )

	So, i hope you understand everything!
