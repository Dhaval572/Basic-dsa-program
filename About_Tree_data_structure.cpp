// About tree data structure

/*

=>	A tree data structure is a way to organize data in a hierarchy, like a family tree, that makes it easy to find, add, or remove items.

=>	Tree data structures are non-linear data structures.

Structure of tree is: 

	    A         <-- Root Node
       / \
      B   C       <-- Child Nodes
     / \   \
    D   E   F     <-- Leaf Nodes

	In upper side, you can see the basic structure of tree.

	Root Node: 

		This node is a top most node of the tree.

	Child node: 

		This node is connected by another node.

	Leaf node: 

		Node with no children means you can say that this is a last node of tree.
		
		( Note: leaf node is also known as external node )

	Internal node: 

		This node contains atleast one child node. So this is a apposite of External node.

	So, This is a basic strcuture of tree data structure.

	I hope you understande!!
