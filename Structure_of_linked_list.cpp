// Note : copy this all to vs code to look diagram perfect
// Diagram of linked list:

/*
    +--------+     +--------+     +--------+     +--------+
    | Data: 1| ->  | Data: 2| ->  | Data: 3| ->  | Data: 4| -> nullptr
    | Next:->|     | Next:->|     | Next:->|     | Next: n|
    +--------+     +--------+     +--------+     +--------+

/*

    Upper side is a diagram of linked list in which all elements are connected to his next element

    So this structure is looked link chain, so there for it is called linked list means that all elements is linked with other elements.

    In linked list all elements are called node.

    In linked list first node is known as head node.

    In linked list always remember that last Node always connects to the null.

    So here is more one simple diagram of node:

    [Head Node] -> [next Node] -> [next Node] -> [Next Node] -> null

    More simplification:

    [Node 1] -> [Node 2] -> [Node 3] -> [Node 4] -> null

    I hope you understand the structure of a linked list.
