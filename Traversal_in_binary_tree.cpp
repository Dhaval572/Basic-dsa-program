// Travertion explaination in binary tree

/*

So, in this we will see that how to perform traversal operation in binary tree So get start.

Travertion:

	Travertion is a proccess in which we access all element of data structure.

Explaination of traversal in binary search:

	In binary tree, there are three ways to travers tree

	1. Pre-order traversal:

		Pre-order traversal is a way to visit nodes in a binary tree where you check the current node first, then the left child, and finally the right child. 
		
		It follows this order: Root → Left → Right.

	2. Post-order traversal: 

		Post-order traversal is a way to visit nodes in a binary tree where you check the left child first, then the right child, and finally the current node. 
		
		It follows this order: Left → Right → Root.

	3. In-order traversal: 

		In-order traversal is a way to visit nodes in a binary tree where you check the left child first, then the current node, and finally the right child. 
		
		It follows this order: Left → Root → Right.

	So, that all are types of traversal in binary tree

	I hope you understand!!
